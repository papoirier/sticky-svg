# sticky-svg

A 'sticky' `svg`  background shape.

In this demo, the shape can have three color states, with animations associated to them.

Once the shape entirely comes into view, it 'sticks' to the bottom of the screen. Once it gets past a certain point, it 'unsticks' and follows the `divs` going away.
